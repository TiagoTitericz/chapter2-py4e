Void Functions
Void functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect,
but they donâ€™t have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable,
you get a special value called None.
>>> result = print_twice('Bing')
Bing
Bing
>>> print(result)
None

Fruitful Functions
To return a result from a function, we use the return statement in our function.
For example, we could make a very simple function called addtwo that adds two
numbers together and returns a result.

def addtwo(a, b):
    added = a + b
    return added

x = addtwo(3, 5)
print(x)
