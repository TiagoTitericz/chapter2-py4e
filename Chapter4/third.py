'''Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and
1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is
between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:

Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F

Enter score: 0.95
A

Enter score: perfect
Bad score

Enter score: 10.0
Bad score

Enter score: 0.75
C
'''

prompt = input("Enter a score: ")
try:
    score = float(prompt)
    if score >= 1.0 or score < 0:
        print("Bad score")
    elif score >= 0.9:
        print("A")
    elif score >= 0.8:
        print("B")
    elif score >= 0.7:
        print("C")
    elif score >= 0.6:
